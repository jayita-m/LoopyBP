# LoopyBP
Loopy Belief Propagation for non-cyclic MRFs (Sum-Product/Max-Product)


Implemented for the Graph Coloring problem 
Given a graph G = (V, E), a valid vertex coloring of a graph with a budget of k > 0 colors is
an assignment of a color to each vertex of the graph so that no two neighboring vertices receive
the same color.
